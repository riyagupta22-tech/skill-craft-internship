## Introduction

This project aims to implement a hand gesture recognition system that can identify various hand gestures using a machine learning model. Additionally, the project includes a K-means clustering algorithm to segment customers of a retail store based on their purchasing behavior, helping the store to better understand and target its customers.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hand-gesture-recognition-and-kmeans.git
cd hand-gesture-recognition-and-kmeans
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Hand Gesture Recognition Model
Data Collection
The dataset for hand gesture recognition can be collected using a camera. Ensure that the dataset contains various hand gestures with enough samples for each gesture.

Model Training
To train the hand gesture recognition model, use the following command:
python train_gesture_model.py --data_dir path/to/dataset --output_model path/to/save/model

Model Evaluation
Evaluate the trained model using:
python evaluate_gesture_model.py --model path/to/saved/model --test_data path/to/test/data

Customer Segmentation with K-means
Data Preprocessing
Preprocess the retail store customer data to make it suitable for clustering.

Clustering
Run the K-means clustering algorithm:
python kmeans_clustering.py --data path/to/customer/data --clusters 5 --output path/to/save/clusters

Visualization
Visualize the clustering results:
python visualize_clusters.py --data path/to/customer/data --clusters path/to/saved/clusters
